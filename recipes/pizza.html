    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    <img src="../images/pizza.jpg">
    <p>Pizza is a universally loved dish that has a rich history dating back to ancient civilizations. The origins of pizza can be traced back to the Neapolitan region of Italy where it was originally made as a simple, cheap food for the working class. The classic Margherita pizza, made with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil, was created in honor of Queen Margherita of Savoy and is now considered a staple of traditional Italian cuisine. Over time, pizza has evolved to include a variety of ingredients and toppings to cater to different tastes and cultural influences. Today, pizza is enjoyed by people all over the world and can be found in an endless number of styles and variations, from classic Margherita to deep-dish Chicago-style and everything in between.</p>
