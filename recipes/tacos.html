Over time, tacos have evolved to include a variety of fillings, such as ground beef, chicken, fish, and vegetables, and are now enjoyed all over the world. Tacos are typically served with a variety of toppings, including cheese, salsa, avocado, and sour cream, and can be enjoyed as a quick and satisfying meal.
