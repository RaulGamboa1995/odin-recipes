    <img src="../images/sushi.jpg">
    <p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that has been enjoyed for centuries. It originated in the country's ancient capital, Nara, where fish was fermented and wrapped in rice and seaweed to preserve it for travel. Over time, the dish evolved into the sushi that we know today, which features fresh fish and vegetables paired with vinegared rice. Sushi quickly gained popularity in Japan and spread throughout Asia before making its way to the West in the 20th century. Today, sushi is a beloved dish around the world, and there are many different styles and variations of sushi, including maki rolls, nigiri, and sashimi. Whether enjoyed in a sushi restaurant or made at home, sushi remains a staple of Japanese cuisine and a beloved food enjoyed by people of all ages and cultures.</p>
